The line and stacked column chart above shows the monthly revenue and expenses trend for the total transactional amount. From the above, we can deduce certain key takeaways such as:
1. Both revenue and expenses show a significant increase starting mid-year, with expenses consistently outpacing revenue until late in the year. This is also what is influencing profit and at mid-year, we see profit also drop significantly due to the rise of expenses as against revenue.

# Recommendations:

1.There is a saying that, "To become a millionaire and be able to earn 7-8 figures, you need to learn to let money work for you and have a diversified portfolio". As a result, seeing how the revenue for this SaaS company only comes from two sources, I would advice the company to consider investing into prominent and promising investment opportunities as well. The interest on these investments will contribute to increasing their only streams of income by a number or two.

2. Across board, its deduced that General and Administrative expense covers majority of the expenses and as a result, it's crucial to identify if the company is overpaying some employees and if there is a way to reduce that.
3. The company should also look to cut down a little on ther Sales and Marketing expense as well as Research and Development expense while still maintaining highest advertisement qualities.

# Conclusion: 
I believe this is a company that has great potential going forward if they are able to cut down a little cost whiles still employing qualified employees and also providing quality advertisement and sales processes. I also believe that, accepting to invest in investment opportunities will contribute to seeing more revenue streams hence increasing their overall profitability.

Thank you.
